// Loading diagnostics for the Wii port.
//
// The question a plain step log cannot answer is whether a load that shows no
// progress is stuck or merely slow, because the thread that would print the
// answer is the one that stopped.  So the step is recorded by the game thread
// and reported by a separate one.

// The one switch for diagnostics on this port.  At 1 every line goes to
// SYS_Report and into debug.log beside the ELF; at 0 NOTHING below runs at all.
//
// SYS_Report reaches a USB Gecko or a connected debugger and nothing else, so on
// a retail console with neither there is nothing at all to read when the game
// stops responding -- which is the one case these diagnostics exist for.  Wiring
// the same lines to storage is what makes a freeze on real hardware legible.
//
// Turning it off is worth real time rather than just a quieter screen.  The
// expensive part was never SYS_Report, which costs nothing with no cable
// attached: it is the work done to reach it.  wiiLog formats into a 512 byte
// buffer for every model, texture and stream the game touches, and streaming
// touches thousands while driving; WiiTraceNote copies each of those strings
// again; WiiTraceHeap walks the whole heap through mallinfo; and the watchdog is
// a thread with an 8KB stack waking once a second.  At 0 none of that is
// compiled in, and the watchdog is never started.
//
// Default is off (real-Wii release).  The CMake WII_CREATE_LOG option defines
// this before the header is parsed so the Dolphin/dev build can turn it on
// without editing the source.
